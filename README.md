# image-split
A program that allows you to progressively make an image clearer and clearer.

# Inspiration
image-split was inspired by https://koalastothemax.com/, a website that allows you to make images of koalas clearer and clearer by splitting apart pixel-like circles which make up the image. I took this idea and extended it by using completely random images from https://picsum.photos, and used actual squares instead of circles for the "pixels".

# Implementation
image-split is written in Java and uses the AWT API (included in the java.awt package) to render the image on screen.

# Demo
Below are three different demos of the program, each with a different image. They are sped up so that you can see how the image eventually looks.
